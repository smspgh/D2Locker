# D2L UI

This package is meant to be home to all the "generic" D2L UI pieces and helpers (some of which is Destiny-specific, much of which is just D2L-specific). Things like buttons, dialogs, headers, and helpers. For UI elements that are specific to particular D2L functionality, put them in their appropriate feature folder.
