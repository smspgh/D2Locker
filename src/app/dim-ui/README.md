# DIM UI

This package is meant to be home to all the "generic" DIM UI pieces and helpers (some of which is Destiny-specific, much of which is just DIM-specific). Things like buttons, dialogs, headers, and helpers. For UI elements that are specific to particular DIM functionality, put them in their appropriate feature folder.
